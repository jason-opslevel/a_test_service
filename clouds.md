Genus cirrus
Abbreviation: Ci

Cirriform clouds tend to be wispy and are mostly transparent or translucent. Isolated cirrus do not bring rain; however, large amounts of cirrus can indicate an approaching storm system eventually followed by fair weather.

There are several variations of clouds of the cirrus genus based on species and varieties:

Species

Cirrus spissatus (V-3)

Cirrus fibratus radiatus (V-8)


 

Cirrus uncinus (V-2)
Cirrus fibratus (V-1)
High clouds having the traditional "mare's tail" appearance. These clouds are long, fibrous, and curved, with no tufts or curls at the ends.
Cirrus uncinus (V-2)
Filaments with up-turned hooks or curls.
Cirrus spissatus (V-3)
Dense and opaque or mostly opaque patches.
Cirrus castellanus (V-4)
A series of dense lumps, or "towers", connected by a thinner base.
Cirrus floccus (V-5)
Elements which take on a rounded appearance on the top, with the lower part appearing ragged.[11]
Varieties
Opacity-based
None; always translucent except species spissatus which is inherently opaque.[12]
Fibratus pattern-based
Cirrus fibratus intortus (V-6)
Irregularly curved or tangled filaments.
Cirrus fibratus vertebratus (V-7)
Elements arranged in the manner of a vertebrate or fish skeleton.
Pattern-based variety radiatus
Large horizontal bands that appear to converge at the horizon; normally associated with fibratus and uncinus species.
Cirrus fibratus radiatus (V-8)
Cirrus uncinus radiatus (V-9)
Pattern-based variety duplicatus
Sheets at different layers of the upper troposphere, which may be connected at one or more points; normally associated with fibratus and uncinus species.
Cirrus fibratus duplicatus (V-10)
Cirrus uncinus duplicatus (V-11)
Spissatus, castellanus, or floccus[11][12]
Varieties are not commonly associated.
Supplementary features
Precipitation-based
Not associated with cirrus.
Cloud-based
Mamma
Bubble-like downward protuberances; mostly seen with species castellanus.[13]
Genitus mother clouds
Cirrus cirrocumulogenitus
Cirrus altocumulogenitus
Cirrus cumulonimbogenitus
Cirrus homogenitus
Cirrus formed by spreading of aircraft contrails.
Mutatus mother cloud
Cirrus cirrostratomutatus
Cirrus homomutatus
Cirrus formed by the complete transformation of cirrus homogenitus.
